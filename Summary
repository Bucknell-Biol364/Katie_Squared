Sex-Ratio Manipulation in Color Banded Populations of Zebra Finches
Nancy Burley
Evolution 1986

Background: Studies of captive and wild birds often use color bands to mark subjects. Questions regarding whether band color influences mate preference and subsequent life history processes and rates should be studied and results integrated into banding procedures.

Study:
  Hypothesis: parents bias the sex ratio of their clutches to produce more of the offspring that they expect to be more attractive
    Alt hypothesis 1: sex ratio of clutches change with parental age and experience
    Alt hypothesis 2: sex ratio of clutches change with parental ability to raise daughters/sons

  BME = banded males, unbanded females (duration 22 months)
    - Males have red (preferred), orange (neutral), or green (avoided) bands
  BFE = banded females, unbanded males (duration 10 months banded, additional 5 months unbanded)
    - Females have black (preferred), orange (neutral), or blue (avoided) bands
  
Results: parents do select offspring of the same sex of the apparently more attractive parent (more pronounced in BME)
  
        
Difficult to reproduce because...
  - No supplemental data file with raw numbers
  - Lack of clarity with sample sizes and what data points were included in analysis
  - No information about adult sex ratio and inbreeding coefficients of captive colonies, both of which affect reproductive success
  

Irreproducible text-book "knowledge": The effects of color bands on zebra finch fitness
Wang et al 2018

7 researchers form the Department of Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Seewiesen, Germany
  - Conducted analysis of their previous experiments as well as a re-analysis of replication study of Burley 1986, and 39 papers that support Burley to varying extents 

Disagreement between literature and experimental evidence


Analysis of effects of band color on reproductive success from previous 8 studies
  - Analyzed data from 8 studies on band color from their own lab, unpublished data from 3 other laboratories
  - Used linear mixed-effect models to investigate reproductive success of all individuals involved in the 8 studies
      - Modeled male and female fitness and fit band color, individual identity, aviary identity, experiment identity, and population identity as random effects
      - Controlled for adult sex ratio within each aviary, duration of breeding season, and individuals inbreeding coefficient as fixed effects
  - Reproductive success varied significantly in individuals with inbreeding and adult sex ratio, but not with duration of breeding season or band color


Analysis of effects of band color on sex ratios from unpublished replication study
  - Obtained summarized data of offspring production gathered by Nikolaus von Englehardt and 3 collaborative labs, who did an experiment that closely followed the design of     Burley et al 1986
  - Used mixed effect model with mean number of offspring as the dependent variable and aviary and population as random effects and "attractiveness rank" as a fixed effect
  - Results did not support previous findings that band color infuences relative reproductive success of males


Analysis of effect size from previous publications
  - Extracted estimates of effect size of red and green banded males on dependent variables of 39 studies
    - Dependent variables included: male body mass, male dominance, approach times in a choice test, copulation rates, measures of parental effort, yolk hormone concentrations, offspring sex ratio
  - Band color effects on these variables were then transformed using Cohen's D (a measure of effect size which indicates the standardized difference between means. Cohen's D uses the average of two groups as well as their pooled standard deviations to represent the effect size)
  - Effect size significantly related to sample size and was exaggerated in smaller sample sizes
     - Suggested minimum sample size = 35 individuals (Burley max sample size = 26)


Key Points:
  - Despite the literature, no evidence that band color is associated with male or female fitness or explains variance in reproductive success
  - Previous studies reporting effects of band color on reproductive success are likely underreporting nonsignificant effects and may be reporting results of type 1 errors as significant findings. Additionally, reported effects of band color on reproductive success may be due to small sample sizes (which this study found to exaggerate effect size)
  - Prevalence of support for this color band hypothesis despite experimental evidence otherwise suggests the existence of a publishing bias
