Sex-Ratio Manipulation in Color Banded Populations of Zebra Finches
Nancy Burley
Evolution 1986

Study:
  Hypothesis: parents bias the sex ratio of their clutches to produce more of the offspring that they expect to be more attractive
    Alt hypothesis 1: sex ratio of clutches change with parental age and experience
    Alt hypothesis 2: sex ratio of clutches change with parental ability to raise daughters/sons

  BME = banded males, unbanded females (duration 22 months)
    - Males have red (preferred), orange (neutral), or green (avoided) bands
  BFE = banded females, unbanded males (duration 10 months banded, additional 5 months unbanded)
    - Females have black (preferred), orange (neutral), or blue (avoided) bands

Difficult to reproduce because...
  - No supplemental data file with raw numbers
  - Lack of clarity with sample sizes and what data points
