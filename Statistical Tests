Statistics:
  - Ratio of sons to entire clutch size of males with different color bands (BME) [Goodman and Kruskal, Fisher 2 x 3 Exact post hoc]
  - Ratio of sons to entire clutch size of females with different color bands (BFE) [Goodman and Kruskal, Fisher 2 x 3 Exact post hoc]
  - Determining if primary or secondary manipulation of sex ratio occurs [chi-square]
  - Determining if parents preferentially provision more attractive offspring [ANOVA, Duncan's multiple range test post hoc]
  - Determining if chicks that died in clutches were ones that supported the sex ratio hypothesis... ?

  - Non-parametric test to determine how similarly data ranked by criteria A is to the same data ranked by criteria B 
  - gamma value = proportion of ranked pairs that are in agreement 
      - range = 1 (perfect positive association) to -1 (perfect negative association), with 0 being no association
      gamma = Nc - Nd
              -------
              Nc + Nd
         Nc = total number of pairs that rank the same
         Nd = total number of pairs that rank differently
  - Useful for when there's tied data (where the values in the pair are equal to each other) becaues it excludes them or when there's 
    outliers becaues those do not have a large effect
  - Calculated for ordered data that is either continuous or discrete
  ASSUMPTIONS:
      - Data is measured on an ordinal scale (is ordered)
      - Monotonic relationship between the variables, such that when one increases, the other also either increases or decreases

  BURLEY PAPER:
      - Different color bands are ranked so they have an order
  
Fisher 2 x 3 Exact
http://www.biostathandbook.com/fishers.html
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FishersExactTest.html
  - Used to determine if the proportion of nominal variable A is different depending on the value of nominal variable B --> are
    there non-random associations between two categorical variables?
  - Can be used with a small sample size --> n < 1000, more accurate than chi-square for smaller sample sizes
  - Null hypothesis = the proportions of variable A are the same for different values of variable B
  ASSUMPTIONS:
      - Individual observations are independent
      - Fixed row and column totals 
  R CODE:
  http://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/b_07.html
      - rcompanion package
  BURLEY PAPER:
      - Runs a 2x3 test, when the default ones are 2x2
      - Possible to run Fisher's exact test for each of the pairwise comparisons then correct for multiple comparisons using
        Bonferroni
        
Chi Square
https://www.spss-tutorials.com/chi-square-independence-test/
https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/
  - Used to determine if two categorical variables are related
  - chi square statistic = how different the observed counts are from the counts that would be expected if the null hypothesis was
    true (that there was no relationship between the two variables)
      - low value = high correlation
  - Null hypothesis = two categorical variables are independent of each other
  ASSUMPTIONS:
      - Samples are independent and random
      - Expected frequency count for each variable is at least 5
  R CODE:
      - chisq.test(table)

      - Double check sample sizes? Mentions that they were small
