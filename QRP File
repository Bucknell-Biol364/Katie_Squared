Burley 1986 - Sex-Ratio Manipulation in Color-Banded Populations of Zebra Finches

Because this study is based off a published paper and we don't have insight into Burley's decision making, we cannot know for certain if any of these QRPs occurred.

Cherry-picking
  - Not reporting studies or variables that failed to reach statistical significance (SS)
  - Not reporting covariates that failed to reach SS
  - Reporting a subset of statistical models as the complete tested set
  
  Burley reported non-significant results (offspring sex-ratio in BFE during the first 10 months; sex-ratio of brood losses in BME; offspring pre- and post-fledging weight and sex, maternal band color, brood size in BME and BFE; band color and offspring sex ratio for clutches where at least one egg failed to hatch; brood size and band color in BFE), suggesting that overall cherry-picking of the data did not occur. However, she did have some instances where she determined what number of data points would result in a significant effect.

HARKing
  - Reporting an unexpected finding as having been predicted
  
  There is always a risk that this occurred, especially because she reported her own previous studies pairs bias offspring sex ratios in favor of the more attractive parents and that birds have a band color preference and these expectations may have colored her interpretation of these results, even unintentionally. However, we can't say definitively. A good way to avoid this would be to come up with predictions and hypotheses before the experiment is run.
  
P-hacking
  - Rounding off a p-value or other quantity to meet a pre-specified threshold
  - Deciding to exclude data points after first checking the impact on SS
  - Collecting more data for a study after first inspecting whether results are SS
  - Changing to another type of statistical analysis after the first analysis initially chosen failed to reach SS
  
  Burley rounded off p-values to the third decimal place and for every test she ran, she reported r^2 and p-values, regardless of their significance. 


General improvements to the study:
  - Make all of the data available in a supplementary document
  - More clearly explain why, if applicable, some data points are excluded from analyses
  - More clarity with sample sizes
  - More clarity on the timeline of the study and reasoning behind methodological decisions
