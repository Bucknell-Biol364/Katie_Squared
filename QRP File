Burley 1986 - Sex-Ratio Manipulation in Color-Banded Populations of Zebra Finches

Because this study is based off a published paper and we don't have insight into Burley's decision makin, we cannot know for certain if any of these QRPs occurred.

Cherry-picking
  - Not reporting studies or variables that failed to reach statistical significance (SS)
  - Not reporting covariates that failed to reach SS
  - Reporting a subset of statistical models as the complete tested set
  
  

HARKing
  - Reporting an unexpected finding as having been predicted
  
P-hacking
  - Rounding off a p-value or other quantity to meet a pre-specified threshold
  - Deciding to exclude data points after first checking the impact on SS
  - Collecting more data for a study after first inspecting whether results are SS
  - Changing to another type of statistical analysis after the first analysis initially chosen failed to reach SS
