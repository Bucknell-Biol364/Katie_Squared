Hypothesis: parents bias the sex ratio of their clutches to produce more of the offspring that they expect to be more attractive
  Alt hypothesis 1: sex ratio of clutches change with parental age and experience
  Alt hypothesis 2: sex ratio of clutches change with parental ability to raise daughters/sons
  
Conditions necessary for hypothesis to be supported:
  1. Heritable variation in traits conferring attractiveness
  2. Expression of traits is sex-limited
  3. Relative attractiveness affects reproductive success
  4. Preference for attractive trait is common to some fraction of population
  5. Mating system allows substantial fraction of males to obtain mate
  6. Economical method of sex-ratio manipulation exists
  
BME = banded males, unbanded females
BFE = banded females, unbanded males

Previous studies:
  - males prefer females with black bands
  - females prefer males with red bands

Statistics:
  - Ratio of sons to entire clutch size of males with different color bands (BME)
  - Ratio of sons to entire clutch size of females with different color bands (BFE)
  -
