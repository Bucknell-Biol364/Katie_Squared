Hypothesis: parents bias the sex ratio of their clutches to produce more of the offspring that they expect to be more attractive
  Alt hypothesis 1: sex ratio of clutches change with parental age and experience
  Alt hypothesis 2: sex ratio of clutches change with parental ability to raise daughters/sons
  
Conditions necessary for hypothesis to be supported:
  1. Heritable variation in traits conferring attractiveness
  2. Expression of traits is sex-limited
  3. Relative attractiveness affects reproductive success
  4. Preference for attractive trait is common to some fraction of population
  5. Mating system allows substantial fraction of males to obtain mate
  6. Economical method of sex-ratio manipulation exists
  
BME = banded males, unbanded females (duration 22 months)
BFE = banded females, unbanded males (duration 10 months banded, additional 5 months unbanded)

Previous studies:
  - males prefer females with black bands (and avoid blue banded females)
  - females prefer males with red bands (and avoid green banded males)
  - both sexes treat orange bands as unbanded bird (intermediate attractiveness)

Statistics:
  - Ratio of sons to entire clutch size of males with different color bands (BME) [Goodman and Kruskal, Fisher 2 x 3 Exact post hoc]
  - Ratio of sons to entire clutch size of females with different color bands (BFE) [Goodman and Kruskal, Fisher 2 x 3 Exact post hoc]
  - Determining if primary or secondary manipulation of sex ratio occurs [chi-square]
  - Determining if parents preferentially provision more attractive offspring [ANOVA, Duncan's multiple range test post hoc]
  - Determining if chicks that died in clutches were ones that supported the sex ratio hypothesis... ?
