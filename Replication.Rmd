Irreproducible text-book "knowledge": The effects of color bands on zebra finch fitness
Wang et al 2018
Purpose:
  - To test for the effects of band color on reproductive success in captive zebra finches

Hypothesis:
  - Colorful leg bands affect attractiveness of male and female zebra finches

Methods:
  - Analyzed data from 8 studies on band color from their own lab, unpublished data from 3 other laboratories
  - Modeled male and female fitness and fit band color as a random effect
      Models 


Results:
  - Reproductive success varied in individuals rather than color band groups
  - Reproductive success significantly declined as inbreeding increased 
  - Reproductive success varied significantly with adult sex ratio
  - Reproductive success did not vary significantly with duration of breeding season
  - Reproductive success did not vary at all with band color
  - Effect size of reproductive success exaggerated in smaller sample sizes but was not significantly different in larger sample sizes
      - Suggested minimum sample size was 35 individuals (Burley max sample size = 26)
  
Discussion:
